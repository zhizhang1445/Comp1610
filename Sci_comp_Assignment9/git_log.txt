    Added the timings text files and finished with the job script and compiled them on home to keep a copy. This is almost ready to submit

    Working version of omp and mpi code. Also added script for omp. Note that I used the debugjob to allocate instead of sbatch for omp. TODO: timing analysis for mpi code. Also not that MPI_FlOAT instead of MPI_DOUBLE gives you the strangest fucking error
