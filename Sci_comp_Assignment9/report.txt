Using OpenMP, the timing actually looks like Amdahl's law. 
We get speedup until we hit a non-paralelizable fraction of about 3.710s. 
There doesn't seem to be anything that disagress with Amdahl's law for the OpenMP script. 

On the MPI side, the timing up to 16 threads seems to agree with Amdahl's law.
However, between 16 and about 20 threads the real time is actually increasing.
This is probably because communication between two nodes (each having 16 threads) is slower than inside a node. 
Therefore it takes a while for the standard speedup of Amdahl's law to catch up. 
In the end, however, we still get a significant speedup by using 32 threads. 

The timing results for both are in timinings_mpi.txt and timings_omp.txt.
