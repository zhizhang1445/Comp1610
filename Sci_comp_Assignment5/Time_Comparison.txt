Here are the different time comparisons:
Times were computed using time, the built-in command in bash. 
Also note that they were computed using wave1d_noOutput, where the output operations where removed to only test the runtime. 

dgemc:

real 3m40.035s

dgbmc:

sys 5m25.674s


We can clearly see that the full matrix multiplication is slower than the banded version.
The main difference for the algorithm is:
Banded matrices stores has a lot less elements than a full matrix.
Instead of repeatedly acessings zeros in both the matrix, the banded algorithm can skip then.
Futhermore instead of having to access the entire range of elements in the vector, the banded algorithm access three at a time. 
This basically turns our matrix multiplication from a cubic algorithm into a linear one.
